## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-adminer/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: true

  vars:
    adminer_add_apache_config: true

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache.
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        update_cache: "true"
        cache_valid_time: "600"
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
      changed_when: false

  roles:
    - role: buluma.adminer
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-adminer/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
      # - role: buluma.python_pip
      # - role: buluma.apache
      # - role: buluma.ca_certificates
      # - role: buluma.openssl
```
